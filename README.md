This repo contains examples of Supervised and Unsupervised machine learning
algorithms. All were constructed in scikit-learn.

For supervised learning:
Regression:
Linear Regression

Classification:
Naive Bayes (Using CountVectorizer)

For Unsupervised Learning:
K-Means with both CountVectorizer and TfidfVectorizer

Future Plans:
Extend the Datasets to more algorithms.
